            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>Hi! this is <i>Vitor</i> and I'm a sophomore <i>Computer Science</i> undergraduate student at the <i>State University of Londrina</i>. I didn't have any computer science experience when starting my course and was not really sure if that major was the right for me. It turns out that it really was and I'm gonna love work with it in the future.</p>

            <p>I've been exploring the lands of <i>full-stack web development</i> for the past few months and it's been really interesting for me. I'm going to learn mobile development in the future too because that's another field I'm very interested in. By the way, almost everything in the computer science field gets me interested. I just cannot see time passing while I'm understanding how all the magic behind computers is supposed to work.</p>
            <p>That is a very challenging major to get, computer science is extremely difficult but it is rewarding at the same intensity. Today it is part of every other field of science helping all the kinds of knowledge to grow.</p>
